# Handling Events in React
In React, events are actions that occur when the user interacts with a component, such as clicking a button or typing in a text input. Handling events in React involves writing JavaScript functions that are triggered when these events occur, and then updating the state or triggering some other action based on the event.

To handle events in React, we use the **onEventName** syntax, where *EventName* is the name of the event we want to handle. For example, the *onClick* event is triggered when a button is clicked, and the *onChange* event is triggered when the user types in a text input.

When an event is triggered, React passes an event object to the event handler function. This event object contains information about the event, such as the target element and any data associated with the event.
